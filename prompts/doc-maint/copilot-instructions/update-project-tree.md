# Project Structure Update Instructions

I need to update my Copilot instructions with the latest project structure. My project is an image classification system using FastAI and CNN models to detect differences between genuine and counterfeit cards.

## What Changed
My project structure has evolved with [BRIEFLY DESCRIBE CHANGES: new data folders/new model types/reorganized utilities/etc.]. 

## What I Need
Please update the directory tree section in my Copilot instructions with this new structure. When updating:

1. Keep the existing annotations for directories that haven't changed (e.g., `# Image data directories`)
2. Add similar brief annotations for any new major directories
3. Ensure the formatting is consistent with the existing tree structure
4. Update any module descriptions that reference files that have been moved or renamed

## New Project Structure
Here's the current project structure from running `tree | grep -v -E "jpg|jpeg|png"`:

```

```

When returning the updated Copilot instructions, please:
- Only show the changes to the "Project File Structure" section
- Add brief annotations for any new major directories
- Note any module descriptions that may need updating based on file path changes
