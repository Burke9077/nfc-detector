# Pokemon Error Card Collecting and NFC Detection

## What Are Error Cards?

Error cards in the Pokemon TCG are cards that have some manufacturing defect or error. These include:

- **Miscuts**: Cards that were cut incorrectly during manufacturing, often showing parts of adjacent cards
- **Crimps**: Cards that have been crimped by packaging machinery
- **Missing foil**: Cards with printing errors where foil layers are missing
- **Ink errors**: Cards with ink splatters, missing ink, or other printing anomalies

## The NFC Problem

NFC (Non-Factory Cut) cards are regular cards or uncut sheets that have been deliberately cut by individuals to mimic factory errors. They're essentially counterfeits in the error card collecting community.

### Why NFCs Are a Problem:

1. **Value misrepresentation**: NFCs are sold as genuine factory errors at inflated prices
2. **Market integrity**: They undermine trust in the collecting community
3. **Collection devaluation**: They reduce the value of legitimate error cards
4. **Difficulty in identification**: NFCs can be challenging to distinguish from genuine errors

## How This Tool Helps

The NFC Card Detector uses machine learning to identify subtle differences in card edges that human eyes might miss:

1. **Edge pattern recognition**: Factory cutting machines leave distinctive patterns
2. **Consistency analysis**: Factory cuts have consistent characteristics across large batches
3. **Microscopic detail**: The tool can detect micro-features invisible to the naked eye

## How to Use This Tool for Authentication

1. Capture high-quality images of your card's edges (front and back)
2. Process the images through the trained models
3. Review the classification results and confidence scores
4. Use this information along with other authentication methods for a final determination

## Other Authentication Methods

While this tool is powerful, consider these additional methods:
- Examine card stock texture and thickness
- Check for consistent factory cutting patterns
- Consult experienced collectors for visual verification
- Review the card's provenance and seller history

Remember: This tool is meant to be an aid in authentication, not the sole determinant of a card's legitimacy.
