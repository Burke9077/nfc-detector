# Pokemon Error Card Collecting and NFC Detection

## What Are Error Cards?

Error cards in the Pokemon TCG are cards that have some manufacturing defect or error. These include:

- **Miscuts**: Cards that were cut incorrectly during manufacturing, often showing parts of adjacent cards
- **Crimps**: Cards that have been crimped by packaging machinery
- **Missing foil**: Cards with printing errors where foil layers are missing
- **Ink errors**: Cards with ink splatters, missing ink, or other printing anomalies

## Understanding NFCs

NFC (Non-Factory Cut) cards are created when collectors or sellers cut their own cards from uncut sheets to resemble factory errors. They exist in a unique space within the collecting community:

### The Legitimate Place for NFCs:

- **Affordability**: They provide an accessible way to enjoy error-like cards without the high cost of factory errors
- **Availability**: Genuine uncut sheets can cost $700+, making NFCs a more obtainable option
- **Creativity**: Some collectors enjoy creating and owning these as unique conversation pieces
- **Disclosed Sales**: When properly labeled and sold as NFCs, they represent a legitimate market segment

### Challenges with NFCs:

- **Transparency Issues**: Problems occur when NFCs are misrepresented as genuine factory errors
- **Market Confusion**: Without proper disclosure, they can create uncertainty in the marketplace
- **Value Concerns**: Undisclosed NFCs sold at premium prices can lead to disappointed collectors
- **Authentication Difficulty**: They can sometimes be challenging to distinguish from genuine errors

## How This Tool Helps

The NFC Card Detector uses machine learning to identify subtle differences in card edges that human eyes might miss:

1. **Edge pattern recognition**: Factory cutting machines leave distinctive patterns
2. **Consistency analysis**: Factory cuts have consistent characteristics across large batches
3. **Microscopic detail**: The tool can detect micro-features invisible to the naked eye

This helps both buyers and sellers ensure transparency in transactions, whether for factory errors or properly disclosed NFCs.

## How to Use This Tool for Authentication

1. Capture high-quality images of your card's edges (front and back, edges and corners)
2. Process the images through the trained models
3. Review the classification results and confidence scores
4. Use this information along with other authentication methods for a final determination

## Other Authentication Methods

While this tool is powerful, consider these additional methods:
- Examine card stock texture and thickness
- Check for consistent factory cutting patterns
- Consult experienced collectors for visual verification
- Review the card's provenance and seller history

Remember: This tool is meant to be an aid in authentication, not the sole determinant of a card's legitimacy.
