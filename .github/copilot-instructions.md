# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

## What would you like Copilot to know about you to provide better responses?

I am working on an early-stage image classification project using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). My goal is to determine whether my dataset of a few thousand images is usable before investing in a more complex pipeline.

To achieve this, I am using:
- **FastAI** for training CNN models quickly with minimal code.
- **OpenCV** for basic image visualization.
- **Label Studio** for dataset annotation and exploration.
- **Python** as my primary development environment.

I prioritize:
- **Readable, modular code** with comments explaining key steps.
- **Simplicity over performance** (for now), focusing on quick validation of my data.
- **Pre-trained models (like ResNet)** for transfer learning instead of training from scratch.
- **Visual outputs** where possible (e.g., `.show_batch()`, confusion matrices, and OpenCV plots).

Copilot should:
- Suggest **FastAI-friendly** code when working with image classification.
- Prefer **Python-friendly** code (e.g., `matplotlib.pyplot` for plots, `print()` instead of logging).
- Use **OpenCV (`cv2`)** for image display instead of unnecessary libraries.
- Favor **pre-trained CNNs** like `resnet50`, `resnet101`, or `densenet121` for subtle details, or `efficientnet_b2` for a good balance of performance and speed. Use `resnet34` only when computational efficiency is prioritized over detecting fine details.
- When suggesting dataset preprocessing, use `ImageDataLoaders.from_folder()` and **avoid overly complex manual pipelines**.
- When suggesting image augmentation, use **FastAI transforms**, not raw NumPy operations.
- Add dependencies to requirements.txt when you need them
- Always make machine learning models that are trained at the full input file size. We are looking to pick up on subtle details here that would be lost at lower resolutions. Always train at the full 720p image size.

I would also like Copilot to provide short, **inline comments** explaining key logic.

## How would you like Copilot to respond?

- Respond with **structured, step-by-step code snippets** instead of single-line solutions.
- Provide **explanations** in code comments, but keep responses concise.
- Suggest **function-based** implementations instead of monolithic scripts.
- Offer **Python-friendly** visual outputs when applicable (e.g., `.show_batch()`, OpenCV, or `matplotlib` plots).
- If recommending additional libraries, ensure they are **lightweight and relevant** to my workflow.
- If multiple approaches exist, briefly mention the alternatives but default to **FastAIâ€™s high-level API**.

When troubleshooting errors:
- Prioritize **interpretable debugging steps** (e.g., checking `dls.valid.show_batch()` for bad labels).
- Suggest **practical fixes** before proposing deep-dive solutions.
- Avoid over-complicating things with unnecessary optimizations.

If I need further refinements, Copilot should ask **clarifying questions** instead of making assumptions.
